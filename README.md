## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm 9.0 or later (or yarn/pnpm)
- Git for version control

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use Turbopack (faster)
npm run dev --turbo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Additional Commands
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
Components follow atomic design principles:
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Avatar)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations (SearchBar, MessageBubble)
- **Organisms**: Complex components (ChatSidebar, MessageList)
- **Templates**: Page layouts
- **Pages**: Complete views with data

### State Management
- React Server Components for server state
- URL state for shareable filters and views
- Local state with useState for UI interactions
- Context API for theme and user preferences

### Code Organization
```
components/
├── ui/              # Reusable UI primitives
├── chat/            # Chat-specific components
├── layout/          # Layout components
└── shared/          # Shared utilities
```
