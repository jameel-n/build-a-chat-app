## The Fox, the Zip, and the Forest of Files

In a vast digital forest, a clever fox discovered a shiny new tool called a zip file. “How convenient!” he exclaimed. “I can pack all my things neatly together and send them anywhere!” The fox zipped his treasures and shared them across the network, proud of his tidy efficiency. Soon, others in the forest began using zips too — the owls for their documents, the squirrels for their pictures, and the beavers for their blueprints. The forest hummed with the sound of compression.

One day, a sly snake slithered into the forest with a gift — a zip file gleaming brighter than gold. “Just unzip it, dear fox,” hissed the snake, “and you’ll find wonders within.” The fox, greedy and trusting, unzipped the file without looking closely. But the snake had hidden a trick: inside the zip were paths that crawled outside the folder, slipping past boundaries and overwriting the fox’s most precious files. In a blink, the fox’s den was in ruins.

When the forest elders gathered to investigate, they realized the lesson: not every zip is safe to unzip. A careless extraction can let a danger slip where it shouldn’t. From that day on, the creatures of the forest learned to open zips with caution — checking where each path led before setting it free. And so, in the digital woods, they say: beware the zip that slips beyond its bounds
