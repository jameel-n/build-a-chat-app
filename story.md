# Cross Site Scripting For Kids

Once upon a time in the bustling Kingdom of Webland, there lived a clever little fox named Script. Script loved to sneak into places he didn’t belong. One day, he discovered a grand castle called Siteville, where users from all over came to share 

their messages. The castle guards, proud of their shiny walls, didn’t check the gifts that visitors brought in. So, Script disguised himself as a harmless message and slipped inside. Once within the castle, he began whispering to other users’ browsers, stealing their secrets and causing chaos in the royal database. The citizens panicked, for their precious data had vanished into the shadows.

When the king discovered what had happened, he called upon the wise wizard, Sanitizer. The wizard cast powerful spells called input validation and output encoding, which purified all messages entering the castle. No longer could Script hide within the words of others. From that day on, Siteville learned that even the smallest bit of unchecked input could invite disaster. And so, they lived securely ever after—protected by the simple wisdom: never trust user input.
